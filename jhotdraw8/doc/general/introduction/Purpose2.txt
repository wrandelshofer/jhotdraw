JHotDraw 8 is a framework for drawing editors written in the Java programming
language.

It consists of two parts which can be used independently:

* the framework for structured drawing editors
* the framework for document-based applications

The framework for structured drawing editors can be used to realize drawing
editors for computer aided design and for artistic drawings. 
Drawings can be animated and interactive. It is possible to back a drawing with
a data model, allowing a structured drawing editor to be used as a user interface
for the data model.

The framework for document-based applications can be used to create
applications which comply to platform-specific user interface guidelines. 
Such as such as <<bib.ahig>> and <<bib.whig>>.
