    <p>JHotDraw 8 is a framework for structured drawing editors. 
      It can be used to create many different editors from a simple doodle
      program up to full fledged diagram editors and vector animation tools.</p>

    <p>JHotDraw 8 differs significantly from JHotDraw 7 in the following aspects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JHotDraw 8 is based on JavaFX whereas JHotDraw 7 is based on Swing.</li>
      <li>In JHotDraw 8 the Figure objects are passive and need to be explicitly updated to get
        into a consistent state. In JHotDraw 7 the Figure objects actively maintain a
        consistent state. This passive designs allows to greatly improve
        the performance of the drawing editor.</li>
      <li>In JHotDraw 8 a Drawing has layers and supports styling with CSS.
        These features are not supported in JHotDraw 7.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>JHotDraw consists of the following parts:</p>

    <p><em>Drawing Framework</em><br/>
      This framework provides the building blocks for the creation
      of vector drawing editors. It is located in the

    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Application Framework</em><br/>

    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Sample Applications and Applets</em><br/>
      The samples are located in sub-packages of the
